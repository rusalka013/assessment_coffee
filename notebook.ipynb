    "Assume that a single K-cup is equal to a single serving of coffee. For example, SKU: B007KPFTNG contains 2 boxes of 24 K-Cups. This is equivalent to 48 K-Cups and therefore 48 servings.\n",

What would you tell the Engineering team during tomorrow's meeting? Any problems or inconsistencies you find within the data should be outlined, along with an example from the data set, in a new tab labeled 'Data Inconsistencies'."
